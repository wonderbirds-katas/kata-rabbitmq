@NoUnhandledExceptions
Feature: No Unhandeled Exceptions
  In order to deliver a reliable product
  As a developer
  I do not want exceptions to be reported

  Scenario: Unhandeled Exception Regression Test
    Given the robot and 2 clients are running
    When a TERM signal is sent to all applications
    Then all applications shut down
    And the log is free of exception messages
